🌐 **Welcome to synoptic-github!** 🌐

This template dynamically refreshes to provide a vibrant overview of all your GitHub projects right in your README! It's your one-stop-shop to give folks a snapshot of your code journey.

## 🌟 Features

- **Automatic Updates**: Once set up, your README will update daily with a list of all your GitHub repositories.
- **Hassle-Free**: No need to manually edit this README again. In fact, after the GitHub workflow runs for the first time, any changes to this README will be overridden.
- **Engaging Overview**: Showcase your projects in a fun and engaging manner!

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Create a New Repository**: Click the "Use this template" button to get started.
2. **Wait a Bit**: Give it some time. Once the GitHub Action runs (usually within 24 hours), your README will automatically be updated with your project list.

## 🔧 Customization

Want to customize how this works or the update frequency? Dive into the `.github/workflows/update-readme.yml` file and make it your own!

## ⚠️ Note

Remember, after the GitHub Action updates the README for the first time, any edits you've made to the README will be overridden. So, any personalization should be done in the workflow or other files!
