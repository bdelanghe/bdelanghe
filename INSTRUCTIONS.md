# üöÄ synoptic-github Instructions üìñ

Hello and welcome to the `synoptic-github` project! Given the dynamic nature of this template, the `README.md` will be auto-updated regularly. So, you might wonder how to get things set up and personalize your repository? Look no further! This instruction guide is here to help.

## üåü Getting Started

1. **Create a New Repository**: Click the "Use this template" button on the `synoptic-github` main page to start your own repository.
2. **Initial Wait**: Once you've created your repository, the GitHub Action is scheduled to run daily. After it runs for the first time, it will auto-update your `README.md` with a list of your repositories.

## üõ† Personalizing

Want to make tweaks to how things work?

1. **Editing the GitHub Action**: The main magic happens in the `.github/workflows/update-readme.yml` file. Dive in there to change the update frequency, modify how repositories are displayed, or add new features!
2. **Note on README Edits**: If you modify the `README.md` directly, remember that it will be overridden once the GitHub Action runs. So, for persistent changes, consider modifying the workflow itself or using other files for detailed information.

Certainly! Safely setting environment variables is crucial for maintaining the security of your project. Here's a section you can include in your `INSTRUCTIONS.md` that provides guidance on safely setting environment variables for GitHub Actions:

## üõ° Setting Environment Variables Safely in GitHub Actions

Sensitive data like tokens and passwords should never be hard-coded into your scripts or GitHub Actions workflow files. Instead, use GitHub's Secrets feature to securely add these values.

Here's how to set them up:

1. **Go to Your Repository**: Navigate to the main page of your repository.

2. **Access the Settings Tab**: On the top navigation bar, you'll find the `Settings` tab. Click on it.

3. **Navigate to Secrets**: On the left sidebar, scroll down until you find the `Secrets` section.

4. **Add a New Secret**: Click on the `New repository secret` button.

5. **Name Your Secret and Add Its Value**: For instance, if you're adding a GitHub token, you might name your secret `INPUT_GITHUB_TOKEN` and paste the token as its value.

6. **Using the Secret in the Workflow**: In your `.github/workflows/update-readme.yml` (or whatever your workflow file is), you can reference the secret as `${{ secrets.INPUT_GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.

Remember:

- Never expose your secret in logs or error messages.
- Secrets are encrypted and can only be accessed by workflows running in the same repository. They cannot be accessed in logs, even if you try to print them.
