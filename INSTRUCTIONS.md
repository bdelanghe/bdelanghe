# 🚀 synoptic-github Instructions 📖

Hello and welcome to the `synoptic-github` project! Given the dynamic nature of this template, the `README.md` will be auto-updated regularly. So, you might wonder how to get things set up and personalize your repository? Look no further! This instruction guide is here to help.

## 🌟 Getting Started

1. **Create a New Repository**: Click the "Use this template" button on the `synoptic-github` main page to start your own repository.
2. **Initial Wait**: Once you've created your repository, the GitHub Action is scheduled to run daily. After it runs for the first time, it will auto-update your `README.md` with a list of your repositories.

## 🛠 Personalizing

Want to make tweaks to how things work?

1. **Editing the GitHub Action**: The main magic happens in the `.github/workflows/update-readme.yml` file. Dive in there to change the update frequency, modify how repositories are displayed, or add new features!
2. **Note on README Edits**: If you modify the `README.md` directly, remember that it will be overridden once the GitHub Action runs. So, for persistent changes, consider modifying the workflow itself or using other files for detailed information.
